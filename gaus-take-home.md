# Gaus Take-Home Project: AI Investment Agent

Hey, Daniel here. I'm very curious to see how you go from 0-1 (we do it daily at Gaus). This project is supposed to give me some visibility into how you do that yourself. My goal is that this makes me excited to work with you!

## üöÄ Ask

Build a simple web app where a user enters an input (could be stock ticker, chat message - your pick) and receives relevant insights about that company.

I am not interested in generic numbers / charts / facts by themselves. If I ask a financial advisor about a company / ETF / sector, I'd expect them to give me an insight that I can't get from browsing Yahoo Finance. I expect the same here.

- Use LLMs for this. Let me know provider you plan to use, and I'll DM you the API key for it.
- No auth / user system required
- You may choose any stack, libraries, or APIs you like. 
- Please make sure I can run it on my end as well (you can send over installation instructions)
- Vibe coding is allowed. Just make sure you can explain what the code does when you send it over.

Examples of directions you could take:
- Explain recent performance and the "why" of ups / downs of the market
- Compare the company to a benchmark (e.g., S&P 500) - explain the difference 
- Identify potential risks or opportunities for the future of the company

## üì¶ Deliverables

- A GitHub repo with:
  - Your code
  - Instructions on how to run it
  - Bonus: a simple README with a quick explanation of what you built, what you would work on next. Especially interested in what issues you ran into and how you faced them / went around them.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timebox

- Limit yourself to **3-4 hours max.** Please don't spend your whole weekend on this :)
- It‚Äôs fine to leave some parts unfinished. I don't need something prod ready or polished, but I do want to see some outputs. Hopefully I learn something cool from using it!
